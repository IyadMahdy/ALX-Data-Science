# This is the Data Visualisation module.

In this module, we learnt about Microsoft PowerBI and DAX. We created dashboards for realistic data about water usage in a fictional country called Maji Ndogo.

The PowerBI directory consists of the PowerBI desktop files (pbix) created, while the other folders contain csv files used throughout the module for training on specific topics.
