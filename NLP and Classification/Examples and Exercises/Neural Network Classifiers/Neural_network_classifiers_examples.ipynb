    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network is a highly parameterised but non-parametric model used for machine learning. We will henceforth refer to it as a neural net or an NN. A NN model can be fit to a set of inputs (X) and outputs (y), like the other regression and classification algorithms we have covered so far. Where a NN differs is in its generalisabilty and the ability to implement non-linear architecture with relative ease. Here, generalisability refers to the ability of a model to adapt properly to new, unseen data drawn from the same distribution as the training data."

    "## Fundamental components\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural nets are highly complex structures which we could spend any arbitrary length of time discussing. For the purpose of brevity, we will narrow our focus to four main areas: layers, the neuron, weights, and activation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the figure below as a reference, we can see that the first segmentation we can make of a single neural net model is into layers. Data is fed in at the left hand side, into the single input layer. It is then passed to and transformed by some arbitrary (up to the designer) number of what are called *hidden layers*, making up the meat of the internals of the model. The last layer, at the far right, is known as the output layer - this is where we collect the predictions we were hoping for. In classification, output values are typically designed to be probabilities of belonging to each of the classes.  \n",

    "### Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental unit of which each layer is comprised is known as the neuron. The neuron is effectively a rendezvous point for some number of inputs, where they are all added together and sometimes modified, before being sent on to the next neuron in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Explore-AI/Pictures/master/sketch-neuron-diagram.png\" alt=\"sketch-neuron-diagram\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As portrayed in the figure above, some number of inputs arrive at the neuron. In the input layer, the input to a neuron is simply a feature value (like someone's age, income, or a pixel value in an image). For neurons in the hidden or output layers, the input to a neuron is the product of the output of another neuron (indicated by $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$) and a corresponding weight (indicated by $w_1, w_2, ..., w_p$), which we will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons can be connected to any number of neurons from the preceding layer, and are usually connected to all of them. Hidden layers whose neurons are each connected to all of the neurons in the preceding layer are called _dense_ or _fully connected_ layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the only job of the neuron is to sum all of the inputs it receives, add some bias term $\\beta$, and ensure that that sum is passed through an activation function. Neurons are also known as _nodes_ or _units_."

    "### Activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of the inputs arriving at the neuron have been summed, they are passed through an activation function. Activation functions are not set on a per-neuron basis, but rather on a per-layer basis. As we will see below, when we manually add each layer to the network, we need to specify the activation function that goes along with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might consider the role of the activation function to be like a switch, which declares whether or not the output from the neuron in question is activated (\"fired\"). This firing is dependent on the value coming out of the neuron. Some activation functions take that one step further, and change the magnitude of the output, thereby changing the affect that that neuron's output has on the whole network.\n",
    "\n",
    "An activation function is simply a mathematical function which takes as its input the output of the neuron. It helps to introduce non-linearity into our model, and for the most part, they normalise the output of the neuron to be between 0 and 1. Two common activation functions are the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and the Softmax. They each have special properties that allow our model to learn non-linear relationships in our data, and are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ReLU(x) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0 &\\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Softmax(x)_i = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_i e^{x_i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU function basically just \"turns off\" a neuron if its input is less than 0, and is linear if its input is greater than zero. The Softmax function is a little different - it applies the exponential function to each of its units, and makes sure the layer as a whole is normalized (i.e., sums to one). We typically use it within the output layer of a NN when we want a categorical probability distribution (such as when predicting which class given input data belongs to). In the figure below, check out the distribution that the Softmax activation function might produce for an input image containing the number 2, from a layer with 10 neurons.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Deep learning** is simply a subset of machine learning in which we specifically use 'deeper' neural network architectures to perform our modeling. The depth of a neural net refers to the increasing number of hidden layers it possesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **epoch** refers to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the network. If we set `epochs=1`, the model will only see each individual observation exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch size** refers to the number of observations in a group, known as a batch, which are sent through the network during training before the parameters (weights) are updated. An epoch might require many batches to complete. For example, if we have 1000 observations and a batch size of 100, one epoch will require 10 batches to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To **flatten** means to convert to a vector of a single dimension. For example, a matrix of dimensions $(3, 16)$ after flattening would have dimensions $(48,)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The term **feedforward** is used to describe a network where the neurons in each layer are only connected to neurons in subsequent layers (and not any preceding layers). Networks in which neurons are connected to neurons from preceding layers, or indeed to themselves, are known as recurrent networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFlow** is an open-source machine learning library which is used to carry out deep learning tasks. **Keras** is a high-level library provided within TensorFlow. It is possible to write TensorFlow code directly, but Keras makes it much easier and intuitive through APIs and logical syntax. We will use Keras to build models in TensorFlow."

It should take as input a 28x28 image (a total of 784 features) and output a 10x1 vector, where the digit predicted to be in the image is indicated by a value of 1 in the position in the vector of that digit. For example, if we input an image of a 2, we would expect an output vector of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - the 3rd position, indicating the '2' digit, has a 1 in it.\n",

    "## What is the role of the `validation_split` argument?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `.fit()` method we specified `validation_split=0.1`. What this does is as follows. During each epoch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The bottom 0.1, or 10%, of the observations specified in `x` and `y`, are held back and not used for training.\n",
    "2. Once training has completed for that epoch, the 10% of rows which were held back are used to validate the model, providing the results for `val_acc` that we see after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a validation subset gives us insight to guide our model training. Unlike other machine learning models we've studied which are able to appropriately terminate learning after reaching some internal stopping criterion, training a neural network is a *non-convex optimisation task* - which in simple terms means that it is difficult to know if we have an adequate model by just looking at training set performance. This is further complicated by the high capacity nature of neural networks; with often hundreds of thousands of parameters available, these models tend to easily overfit (and in some cases memorize) the data they are trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this point practical, by taking a look at the training and validation accuracy versus epoch curves we can see how validation tends to slowly increase and then flatten out. If at any stage we can see the validation curve beginning to drop consistently, it is a sure sign of overfitting and a good place for training to cease. In actual fact, this observation is an important  part of a popular regularization technique know as *Early Stopping*, where we set the number of learning epochs to be a large value, and expect to terminate training when validation performance plateaus.
