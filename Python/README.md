# This is the Python Module

In this module, we learnt everything between the basics of python and more advanced topics.
Each directory contains notebook (ipynb) files where the work is done, alongside other files either needed or created within the notebook.

## Here is the description of the directories:
### Examples and Exercises:
- This directory contains the topics learnt and applied
- The name of each directory inside this one is the respective topic it teaches.

### Code Challenges:
- Contains challenges without solutions to test my knowledge.
- Autograded using the zip file in each code challenge sub-directory.

### Exam:
- A final exam combining all the previously learnt topics.
